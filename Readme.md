 on 12/24/2020, I watched 2 youtube videos that got me thinking about design patterns using SwiftUI and Combine

 I decided to use these ideas as a starting off point for writing a generic Sign Up view using TDD and the skills I've learned the last week or so in The iOS Lead Essentials course
 In the end, I ended up not needing Combine at all, as the logic was contained in the PasswordValidator class

Any comments are welcome.  Please, tell me if you see something that could be done better.
